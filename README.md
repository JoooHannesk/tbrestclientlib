# TBRESTClientLib
Simple ReST client library for ThingsBoard - implementing the administration / user-space API (not device API) – written in Swift.

## 👓 Overview
[ThingsBoard](https://thingsboard.io) is an IoT platform that provides device management and administration, along with multiple options for storing and visualizing time-series data from sensors, field devices, machine control systems, and similar sources.

This library implements selected parts of the ThingsBoard administration and user-space API (not the device API) to enable convenient, programmatic interaction with a ThingsBoard server. For server compatibility details, please refer to the <doc:ReleaseNotes>.

Throughout this documentation, we aim to follow the official ThingsBoard nomenclature and API documentation as closely as possible. While every effort is made to stay aligned, minor deviations may occur.

## 🛠 Development Status – Available Functions (v0.0.24)
This library is **under active development** and is steadily expanding its coverage of the ThingsBoard API. As a result, **not all API endpoints are available yet**. For a detailed and up-to-date overview of the currently supported endpoints, please refer to the [Usage](https://tbrestclientlib.kinzig-developer-docs.com/documentation/tbrestclientlib/usage) section.

⚠️ Caution: Prior to version 0.1.0, the public API may undergo refinements. Any breaking changes are expected to be manageable for existing users.

## 🥾 Motivation
This library originated as a sub-project of a larger system that required reliable and convenient API access to ThingsBoard server instances. As development progressed, it became clear that the API layer represented a substantial project on its own. Consequently, this component was extracted, generalized, and open-sourced for public use.

Please note that the library is under active development and does not yet cover the complete ThingsBoard API surface. The same limitation applies to response models: not all fields defined in the official API schemas are currently mapped or processed. Only those elements required by the original parent project are included.

For a detailed overview of the properties supported by each response model, please refer to `TbDataModels.swift`
