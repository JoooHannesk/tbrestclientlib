# ``TBRESTClientLib``

Simple client library for ThingsBoard server installations implementing the administration / user-space API (not device API) – written in Swift.

## Overview

 [ThingsBoard](https://thingsboard.io) is an IoT platform offering device management, device administration and comes with several possibilities to store and visualise time-series data from e.g. sensors, field-devices, machine control systems, etc. This package implements (in parts) the ThingsBoard administration / user-space API (not device API) for comfortable programmatical interaction with a ThingsBoard server. For compatibility with ThingsBoard server refer to <doc:ReleaseNotes>.

When documenting my code I tried to refere to the official ThingsBoard Documentation nomenclature as well as official API documentation as close as possible. It might did not work out all the time.
